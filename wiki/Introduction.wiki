= Introduction =

Jquery transliterate plugin is a small fast solution for on-the-fly transliteration on the client side. It was originally designed to be used with Serbian language, but through its options, it can be widely used for any type of transliteration, even for low-security encryption to avoid web spiders.

Usage is pretty simple. First of all, you need to include the script file in your page `<HEAD>` section. You have to define your own map for transliteration or use one of the maps plugin comes with. When done, you should simply call the transliterator on the given element(s) with desired set of options. For details, check the [Usage] page.
